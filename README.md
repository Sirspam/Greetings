# Greetings
Beat Saber mod for playing a video on the game's start up
## Usage
To change the video played by Greetings, add an MP4 file to UserData/Greetings. From here the video should be selectable from in game.
## Installation
Download the latest version of Greetings from [releases](https://github.com/Sirspam/Greetings/releases) and slap it into your Beat Saber's plugin folder.

Greetings requires BSML and SiraUtil, which can both be found in ModAssistant.
